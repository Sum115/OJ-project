# Technologies Used

The list of technologies used in this project are:

     • MongoDB: This is a NoSQL database that is efficient in storing data in the form of JSON documents.
     • ExpressJS: The backend for this project is written in express, a server-side application framework where all the logic of GET and POST requests are written in a 
       javascript language, making it easier to interact with the database.
     • ReactJS: It is a javascript frontend framework used for creating dynamic client-side applications. The front end talks with the database through API calls.
     • NodeJS: NodeJS provides the environment for expressJS to run on the backend side.
     • Docker: The purpose of using docker is to add security on the backend side where our whole backend is running inside an isolated docker container.
